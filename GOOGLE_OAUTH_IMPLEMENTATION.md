# Google OAuth Integration Summary

## What Was Added

Google OAuth authentication has been successfully integrated into your Cogmatt application. Users can now sign up and log in using their Google accounts alongside the existing email/password authentication.

## Key Features

✅ **Dual Authentication Methods**

- Continue with Google (OAuth)
- Email & Password (credentials)

✅ **Smart Account Handling**

- Users registering with Google → No password required initially
- Users trying to login with credentials when they registered with Google → See helpful message: "Password not set. Please login with Google or set a password in settings."
- Existing email users can link their Google account seamlessly

✅ **Automatic Email Verification**

- Google OAuth users are automatically marked as verified

✅ **Security**

- CSRF protection with state parameter
- PKCE flow for added security
- HttpOnly cookies for tokens
- Bcrypt password hashing

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Google OAuth Credentials

Follow the detailed guide in `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` to:

1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google+ API
3. Configure OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add credentials to your `.env` file

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback
```

### 3. Test the Integration

```bash
# Start your development server
bun run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
# Click "Continue with Google"
# Authorize with your Google account
# You should be redirected to the dashboard
```

## Optional: Add Set Password Feature

To allow users who registered with Google to set a password later:

1. Add a "Set Password" form in your Settings page
2. Create a `/api/auth/set-password` endpoint in `AuthController.ts`
3. Call `authService.SetPassword(userId, newPassword)`

Example implementation is provided in `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`.
